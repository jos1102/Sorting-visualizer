# Algorithm-Sorting-Visualizer

This project visualizes five most commonly used sorting algorithms: bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort and merge sort. User could run the program on a local machine and see how each algorithm works in action, and how elements are swapped in the array to get to the sorted array in the end.
